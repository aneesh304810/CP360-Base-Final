# Airflow Deployment

## What this component is

A starting configuration is given: schedule every five minutes, catchup off, one active run, pool 8 to 10, one or two retries.

It sits in **OpenShift Platform**, in the **Operations** lane (OpenShift).

## What SEI specifies

### S5 — Ingestion DAG (one, metadata-driven)

ONE DAG for every inbound interface, not one per interface. It is driven by configuration rows, so a new interface is onboarded by adding a row rather than by writing a DAG.

- **Technology.** Airflow 3.0
- **Source.** ingest §5 (p.9)

## The Oracle objects it touches

No foreign key is declared in either document. Every join below
is one a model runs, not a constraint the database enforces.

| Object | What it holds | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `FILE_SCHEMA_CONFIG` | How an active interface is discovered, dated, validated and routed. File-level only — there is deliberately no column mapping table, because the RAW table DDL is the schema contract. | ingest Appendix A (p.18) · §6.1 (p.12) |
| `FILE_REGISTRY` | The lifecycle record per logical interface and business date. It is what makes repeated discovery safe, and ARCHIVED on it is what completeness counts. | ingest Appendix B (p.19) · §6.2 (p.12) |
| `DATE_CONTROL` | The orchestration ledger, and the one object both documents write to. One row per business date, at most one row not COMPLETE at a time, enforced by a unique index on a CASE expression. | ingest Appendix E.1 (p.24) · §6.3 (p.13) · dbt Appendix A.2 (p.25) |

## Still open with SEI

SEI's own ids, so they can be quoted straight back.

- **O2.** Confirm batch SLA, peak timing, representative file sizes and the Oracle connection envelope.

## How this works, from the architecture supplement

### Runtime domains

| Domain | Workloads |
|---|---|
| Orchestration | Airflow scheduler, webserver, triggerer and workers |
| Transformation | dbt task containers launched by Airflow |
| Integration services | API and workflow services |
| CP360 services | FastAPI backend and React UI where deployed on the same platform |
| Platform operations | Logging, metrics, health probes, secret integration and deployment controls |

### Deployment requirements

- Separate configuration from container images
- Immutable, versioned images from the approved internal registry
- Liveness and readiness probes for long-running services
- Defined CPU and memory requests and limits
- Horizontal scaling only for stateless or concurrency-safe services
- Shared storage mounted only where the file-processing contract requires it
- Database schema migration and application deployment versioned and controlled
- Airflow and application logs preserved in the approved evidence platform

### Graceful degradation

- Oracle unavailable: processing does not claim or advance durable state
- Splunk or Integration360 unavailable: core transaction behaviour follows the approved buffering or failure policy and never silently discards required evidence
- SEI APIs unavailable: workflow state remains queryable and safe retry reuses the same correlation and idempotency identifiers
- CP360 UI unavailable: durable ingestion and orchestration state remains in Oracle and Airflow

### CI/CD gates

- Source control to build and unit test
- Dependency and image scan
- Schema and contract tests
- Deploy to OpenShift
- Smoke and connectivity tests
- Controlled environment promotion
