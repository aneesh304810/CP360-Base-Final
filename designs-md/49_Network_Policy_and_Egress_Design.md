# Network Policy & Egress

## What this component is

Network policy and egress. Neither document says what the pipeline is allowed to reach, which matters given it pulls from SFTP and pushes to Splunk.

It sits in **OpenShift Platform**, in the **Operations** lane (OpenShift).

## What SEI specifies

**Nothing.** Neither SEI design document covers this component.

Network policy and egress. Neither document says what the pipeline is allowed to reach, which matters given it pulls from SFTP and pushes to Splunk.

That is not a judgement on whether it is needed. It means no
design exists to build from, and writing one is BBH's to do and
SEI's to confirm.

## How this works, from the architecture supplement

### Runtime domains

| Domain | Workloads |
|---|---|
| Orchestration | Airflow scheduler, webserver, triggerer and workers |
| Transformation | dbt task containers launched by Airflow |
| Integration services | API and workflow services |
| CP360 services | FastAPI backend and React UI where deployed on the same platform |
| Platform operations | Logging, metrics, health probes, secret integration and deployment controls |

### Deployment requirements

- Separate configuration from container images
- Immutable, versioned images from the approved internal registry
- Liveness and readiness probes for long-running services
- Defined CPU and memory requests and limits
- Horizontal scaling only for stateless or concurrency-safe services
- Shared storage mounted only where the file-processing contract requires it
- Database schema migration and application deployment versioned and controlled
- Airflow and application logs preserved in the approved evidence platform

### Graceful degradation

- Oracle unavailable: processing does not claim or advance durable state
- Splunk or Integration360 unavailable: core transaction behaviour follows the approved buffering or failure policy and never silently discards required evidence
- SEI APIs unavailable: workflow state remains queryable and safe retry reuses the same correlation and idempotency identifiers
- CP360 UI unavailable: durable ingestion and orchestration state remains in Oracle and Airflow

### CI/CD gates

- Source control to build and unit test
- Dependency and image scan
- Schema and contract tests
- Deploy to OpenShift
- Smoke and connectivity tests
- Controlled environment promotion
