# SSO

## 1. Purpose & Scope

**SSO design to SWP UI**

Scope as recorded in the component tracker: Configuration only..

## 2. Context & Dependencies

- Depends on components: 2
- Technology: Infra
- Custom build: None — High means a design document is mandatory before code.
- Source of record: SEI v5

### The Foundation plane

**What the pack has.** Quarantine, reconciliation and the configuration store are all genuinely specified — FILE_REGISTRY's lifecycle, dq_validation_failure with resolution_status and reprocess_eligible, RECON_RESULT's three boundaries, FILE_SCHEMA_CONFIG. The error and recovery thinking in D.1 to D.6 is the strongest part of the whole pack.

**What it does not.** Every one of them is inbound and file-shaped. No event dead-letter, no outbound quarantine, nine reconciliation boundaries missing, no schema contract, no expectation model, no loader template registry, no read-only grant, no PII classification, and nine of thirteen Splunk signals with no payload contract. Lineage also degrades permanently under events and the pack does not say so.

**Plane verdict:** 2 of 12 specified · 4 partly · 6 absent.

## 3. Design Decisions

No review finding against this component: the events-primary substitution does not change it.

**Direction.** BBH infrastructure. Nothing to ask SEI.

## 4. Detailed Design

**Deliverable.** SSO design to SWP UI

## 5. Data Quality, Reconciliation & Lineage

No DQ, reconciliation or lineage obligation specific to this component beyond the estate-wide framework.

## 6. Performance & Scale

No performance concern identified for this component under the events-primary assumption.

## 7. Error Handling, Failure & Replay

No unowned error path identified for this component.

## 8. Security & Access Control

Estate defaults apply: a dedicated read-only account for any consumer, business keys masked on read rather than at rest, and secrets from the platform secret store.

**Open.** A12 grants the loader DML on RAW plus the registry, and DML-only on Gold. No consumer grant is described anywhere in the pack, so a read-only role gets improvised at connection time — which in practice means reusing the loader's account. The masking policy for the 786 PII fields in SDC scope is unapproved.

## 9. SEI Source Coverage

**SEI pack coverage: absent** — nothing in the SEI pack.
**Who answers for the gap: BBH** — BBH-owned — do not ask SEI.

No citation recorded. Either this is BBH platform work the pack was never going to cover, or the mapping has not been written yet.

## 10. Gaps, Risks & What Is Missing

### What is missing

Nothing identified. The component is specified and the events-primary substitution does not change it.

### Risk

No ranked bottleneck or unowned error path touches this component.

### Gap against the SEI pack

No absent-coverage citation recorded.

## 11. Recommendation

BBH infrastructure. Nothing to ask SEI.

**Foundation-wide.** Five control tables are specified and each is sound on its own. What is absent is anything that spans them, and that absence is why four error vocabularies already exist in one pipeline before a line of event code has been written. Build the four models once, estate-wide, rather than letting each component grow its own.

## 12. Open Questions & Acceptance Criteria

### Open questions

- **From the tracker.** Federation protocol and identity source?

### Acceptance criteria

- The deliverable above exists and is reviewed.
