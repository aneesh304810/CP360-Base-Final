# G4 Tie-out / Control Totals

## What this component is

SEI reconciles, but not as a gate. The counts are computed and published AFTER the fact build and the verdict is derived in Splunk, so a mismatch alerts rather than blocks.

It sits in **Processing**, in the **Data quality and reconciliation** lane (dbt · Splunk).

## What SEI specifies

**SEI covers the need and answers it differently.** SEI reconciles, but not as a gate. The counts are computed and published AFTER the fact build and the verdict is derived in Splunk, so a mismatch alerts rather than blocks.

### S19 — Reconciliation

Counts at four boundaries for the business date, written to an immutable log and published. The pass or warning verdict is derived on the Splunk side, after the data is already in Gold.

- **Technology.** dbt
- **Source.** dbt §7.2 (p.18) · §7.2.1 (p.18)

## The Oracle objects it touches

No foreign key is declared in either document. Every join below
is one a model runs, not a constraint the database enforces.

| Object | What it holds | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `RECON_RESULT` | One immutable row per boundary per business date, replaced rather than updated. No status column — the verdict is derived in Splunk. | dbt §7.2.1 (p.18) |
| `DQ_VALIDATION_FAILURE` | One store for both failure categories, carrying whether the row can replay itself and whether it is still open. | dbt §7.1 (p.17) |

## What happens when it goes wrong

| # | Scenario | What the design does | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| X35 | Counts do not agree at a boundary | The difference is written to the immutable log and published. The pass or warning verdict is derived on the Splunk side, after the data is already in Gold — so it alerts rather than blocks. | dbt §7.2 (p.18) · §7.2.1 (p.18) |
| X36 | The held backlog is growing | Alerts on the ageing open rows, and the usual cause is a late dimension file. | dbt §7.2.1 (p.18) |
| X37 | DQ or reconciliation is rerun for a date | The DQ rows are upserted so their resolution status survives, the recon rows for that date are replaced, and both are republished. | dbt §8.1 (p.20) |

## Still open with SEI

SEI's own ids, so they can be quoted straight back.

- **D6.** Approve the Splunk event schema, masking and PII rules, dashboards and alert thresholds.

## Gaps and decisions that land here

From the consolidated gap supplement and the CP-Integration-Gateway
readiness review. These arrived after the SEI baseline and in several
places disagree with it; where they do, both readings are given and
neither is silently adopted.

### Gap register

| Gap | What is missing | Required disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `GAP-01` | No single master view joins inbound, outbound, foundation and platform architecture | Add consolidated architecture and responsibility boundaries |
| `GAP-02` | Business capability view is incomplete | Add a capability model across ingress, ingestion, orchestration, processing, foundation and runtime |
| `GAP-12` | Architecture-level acceptance criteria are missing | Add measurable design completion criteria |

### Against what this design already says

#### Conflict — Stage 3 names two different things

- **The supplement says.** Stage 3 IS Pre-Gold, on Oracle Exadata, and a fourth tier - Consumer Movement - carries publish and delivery with no transformation in flight.
- **This design holds.** The data path draws Stage 3 as the warehouse itself, with Pre-Gold as a separate layer before it and no publish tier at all.
- **What it costs to leave open.** Every document that says 'Stage 3' means one of two different databases. The acceptance criterion 'every component is assigned to one canonical domain and tier' cannot be evaluated until this is picked.
- **Decision.** `DEC-GAP-01`

#### Conflict — DIM and FACT are in the wrong tier

- **The supplement says.** Dimensions, facts, aggregates and control-total preparation are Stage 3 Pre-Gold, on Exadata. Stage 2 is normalised canonical entities and stops there.
- **This design holds.** Stage 2 INT is drawn as INT, DIM and FACT together, on the same Oracle estate - which is how both SEI design documents describe it.
- **What it costs to leave open.** This is not a folder move. If the supplement holds, DIM and FACT change database, the dbt chain splits across two estates, and the STG-to-INT reconciliation boundary stops being the last one that matters.
- **Decision.** `DEC-GAP-01`

#### Conflict — Three different counts of reconciliation boundaries

- **The supplement says.** Seven boundaries, including Stage 2 to Stage 3 and publish to consumer acknowledgement.
- **This design holds.** The pack specifies three. The architect review recommends twelve under an event-primary posture.
- **What it costs to leave open.** Nobody can say whether reconciliation is complete, because complete is three, seven or twelve depending on which document is open.
- **Decision.** `none raised - worth one`

#### Conflict — Stage 2 retention is settled here and open there

- **The supplement says.** Seven-day retention WHERE DEFINED, and SILVER-DEC-06 leaves retention and partition management open per entity.
- **This design holds.** Seven days, partition drop, stated flatly on every one of the 52 tables.
- **What it costs to leave open.** The replay window follows from retention. Stating it as settled when it is a per-entity decision makes every replay answer provisional without saying so.
- **Decision.** `SILVER-DEC-06`

#### Closes a gap — Stage 2 to Stage 3 movement has a pattern and a gate

- **The supplement says.** Database-link or direct-path movement preserving LOAD_ID and BUSINESS_DATE, with a reconciliation gate that authorises or holds the publish scope, and a replay boundary scoped by date and load.
- **This design holds.** The database picture has no movement component at all - Pre-Gold simply follows DIM and FACT with nothing in between.
- **What it costs to leave open.** Closed in design. Still needs DEC-GAP-04 to pick the mechanism.
- **Decision.** `DEC-GAP-04`

#### New — LOAD_ID is missing from every model we draw

- **The supplement says.** LOAD_ID is the identifier preserved from RAW through Stage 2, Stage 3, replay and publish evidence, and acceptance criterion 4 depends on it.
- **This design holds.** Stage 1 adds BUSINESS_DATE, SRC_RECORD_ID, FILE_REGISTRY_ID and LOAD_TS. Stage 2's standard columns add MICRO_BATCH_ID and DBT_INVOCATION_ID. Neither carries LOAD_ID.
- **What it costs to leave open.** Without it there is no single identifier for one load execution across four tiers, and the Stage 2 to Stage 3 reconciliation gate has nothing to key on. This is a hole in our own model, not in theirs.
- **Decision.** `SILVER-DEC-04`

#### New — Seven of 52 canonical models exist

- **The supplement says.** The code sample implements Account, Account Optional Field, Asset, Reference, Tax Lot, Transaction Header and Transaction Detail. Four of those seven are mapped to fewer attributes than the canonical model defines. The other 45 are targets.
- **This design holds.** All 52 canonical tables are drawn alike, with no build status at all - a model and an intention look identical.
- **What it costs to leave open.** Anyone sizing the work from our screens sees 52 designed tables and no indication that 45 of them do not exist.
- **Decision.** `SILVER-DEC-01`

#### New — A consumer-oriented model is sitting in Stage 2

- **The supplement says.** int_bbh_open_trade_star joins six INT models into a denormalised target layout and belongs in Pre-Gold or Publish.
- **This design holds.** Nothing. The app models the canonical layer and has no view of what is actually in the dbt project.
- **What it costs to leave open.** Consumer denormalisation inside Stage 2 is what stops Stage 2 being reusable: the next consumer needs a different shape and gets a second star beside the first.
- **Decision.** `SILVER-DEC-07`

#### Confirms the baseline — Dimensions before facts, and no placeholder keys

- **The supplement says.** Build dimensions before facts; late-arriving dimensions are held rather than replaced with placeholder keys.
- **This design holds.** The same, on the transformation chain and the Gold layer.
